The program calculates parameters of a random undirected graph and check if the graph is bipartite or not. 
Randomness of the graph means that on the stage of the graph formation, any two vertices are connected by edge with some probability.

The input parameters: 
1) size of the graph (number of graph nodes);
2) probability of appearance of an edge between any 2 vertices


The output parameters:
1) Number of connected components of the graph;
2) Diameter of the graph;
3) Average cardinality of the connected components of the graph;
4) Whether the graph is bipartite or not
